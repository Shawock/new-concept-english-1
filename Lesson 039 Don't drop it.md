## Lesson 39 Don't drop it

- What're you going to do with that `vase`, Penny?
- I'm going to put it on this table, Sam.
- Don't do that. Give it to me.
- What're you going to do with it.
- I'm going to put it here. In front of the window.
- Be careful, don't drop it. Don't put it there, Sam. Put it here, on the shelf.
- `There we are!` It's a lovely `vase`.
- Those flowers are lovely, too.

> - `vase` 
猜测：听成是 `vars`，应该是个单数的东西，易碎
正解：花瓶 `vase` 英 `[vɑːz]`  美 `[veɪs; veɪz]`
> - `There we are!` 放好了！类似常用表达如下
`Here we go.` 开始啦
`There he/she is.` 就他/她了
`That's it.` 就这样了
`Here we are.` 我们来了
