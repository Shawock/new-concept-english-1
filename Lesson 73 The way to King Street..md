- Last week, Mrs Milth went to London.
- She does not know London very well. And she lost her way.
- Suddenly, she saw a man near a bus stop.
- 'I can ask him the way'. she said to herself.
- 'Excuse me'. She said
- 'Can you tell me the way to King Street, please?'
- The man smiled very pleasantly.
He did not know about English.
He spoke German.
He was a tourist.
Then he put hand into his pocket and took out a phrase book. He opened the book and found the phrases
- 'I am sorry'. He said
- 'I do not speak English'.
