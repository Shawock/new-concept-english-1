## Lesson 101 A card from Jimmy

### 问题有点没听清楚
Does Grandmother `seem pleased` to get a card from Jimmy?

- Read Jimmy's card to me please, Penny.
- I have just arrived in `Scotland`. 
And I'm staying at `a` Youth `Hostel`.
- Eh!?
- He says he's just arrived in Scotland.
He says he is staying at `a` Youth Hostel.
You know, he is a member of the Y.H.A.
- The what?
- The Y.H.A, Mum.
The `Youth Hostel's Association`.
- What else does he say?
- I'll write a letter soon. 
I hope you're all well.
- What?
`Speak up`, Penny.
`I'm afraid I can't hear you`.
He says he'll write a letter soon.
He hopes we are all well.
Love, Jimmy.
- Is that all? 
He doesn't say very much, does he?
- He can't write very much on a card, Mum.

> - `seem pleased` seem 是动词似乎；像是；装作，后面接形容词
> - `Scotland` 不是 `Scottland`
> - `Hostel` ['hɑstl] 招待所 `youth hostel` 青年招待所
> - `Speak up` 说大点声
> - `I'm afraid I can't hear you`. 这句话是奶奶讲的，这样就可以解释了
