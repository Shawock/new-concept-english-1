## Lesson 105 Full of mistakes

- Where's Sandra, Bob?
I want her.
- Do you want to speak to her?
- Yes, I do.
I want her to come to my office.
Tell her to come at once.

How do you spell "intelligent"?
Can you `tell me`?
- I-N-T-E-L-L-I-G-E-N-T.
- That's right. 
You've typed it with only one l.
This letter's full of mistakes.
I want you to type it again.
- Yes, I will do that.
I'm sorry about that.
- And here's a little `present` for you.
- What is it?

I hope it will help you.
