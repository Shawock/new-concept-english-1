## Lesson 103 The French test

- How was the exam, Richard?
- Not too bad.
I think I `passed in` English and Mathematics.
The questions were very easy.
How about you, Gary?
- The English and `Maths` papers `weren't` easy enough for me. 
I hope I haven't failed.
- I think I failed the French `paper`.
I could answer `sixteen` of the questions. 
They were very easy.
But I couldn't answer the rest.
They were too difficult for me.
- French tests are awful, `aren't they?`
- I hate them.
I'm sure I've got a `low mark`.
- Oh, cheer up!
Perhaps we didn't do too badly.
The guy next to me wrote his name at the top of the paper.
- Yes?
- Then he sat there and `looked at it for` three hours.
He didn't write a word.

> - 从 `I hope I haven't failed` 可以看出他希望自己不要挂，很明显是没有自信，说明考题对他来说没那么简单，
所以是 `The English and Maths papers weren't easy enough for me.`
> - `sixteen`/`sixty` 分不出来，操！
> - `French test are awful, aren't they? ` 法语真恶心，你说呢？（注意是 aren't, 第一遍听成 are，主要是否定的 t 可以和后面 they 连读，听不出来）
> - `low mark` 获得了一个低分
