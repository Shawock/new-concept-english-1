## Lesson 109 A good idea

- Shall I make some coffee, Jane?
- That's a good idea, Shalot.
- It's ready, do you want any milk?
- Just a little please.
- What about some sugar? 
Two tea spoon force?
- No, less is met.
One and half tea spoon force please.
That's enough for me.
That was very nice.
- Would you like some all?
- Yes, please.
- I like cigarrate too.
May I have one?
- Of course, I think there are a few in the box.
- I'm afraid it's empty.
- What a pity!
- It doesn't matter.
- Have a biscuit instead.
Ignore and smoke less.
- That's very good advice.
