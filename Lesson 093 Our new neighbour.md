## Lesson 93 Our new neighbour

- Nigel is our new `next-door` neighbour.
- He is a pilot.
- He was in the `R.A.F`.
- He will fly to New York next month.
- The month after next, he will fly to Tokyo.
- At the moment, he is `in` Madrid.
- He flew to Spain a week ago.
- He'll return to London the week after next.
- He is only 41 years old.
- And he has already been to nearly every country in the world.
- Nigel is a very lucky man.
- But his wife isn't very lucky.
- She usually stays at home.
