## Lesson 37 Making a bookcase

- You're working hard, George. What are you doing?
- I'm making a `bookcase`. Give me that `hammer` please, Dan.
- Which hammer? This one?
- No, not that one. The big one.
- Here you are.
- Thanks, Dan.
- What are you going to do now, George?
- I'm going to paint it.
- What color are you going to paint it?
- I'm going to paint it pink.
- Pink! This bookcase isn't for me. It's for my daughter, Susan. Pink's her favourite color.
