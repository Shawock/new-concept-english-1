## Lesson 63 Thank you, doctor

- How's Jimmy today?
- Better. Thank you, doctor.
- Can I see him, please? Mrs. Williams.
- Certainly, doctor. Come upstairs.
- You look very well, Jimmy. You're better now. But you mustn't get up `yet`. You must stay in bed for another two days. 
The boy mustn't go to school yet, Mrs. Williams. And he mustn't eat rich food. 
- Does he have a `temperature`, Doctor?
- No, he doesn't.
- Must he stay in bed?
- Yes. He must `remain` in bed for another two days. He can get up `for about` two hours each day. But you must keep the room warm. 
Where's Mr. Williams this evening?
- He is in bed, doctor. Can you see him, please? He has a bad cold, too.
