## Lesson 107 It's too small

- Do you like this dress, Madam?
- I like the color very much.
It's a lovely dress.
But it's too small for me.
- What about this one?
It's a lovely dress.
It's very smart.
Short `skirts are in fashion` now.
Would you like to try it?
- All right.
I'm afraid this green dress is too small for me as well.
It's smaller than the blue one.
I don't like the color either.
It doesn't suit me at all.
I think the blue dress is prettier.
Could you show me another blue dress?
I want to dress like that one.
But `it must be my size`.
- I'm afraid I havn't got a larger dress.
This is the largest dress in the shop.
