## Lesson 53 An interesting climate

- Where do you come from?
- I come from England.
- What's the climate like in your country?
- It's mild, but it's always not pleasant. The weather's often cold in the north and windy in the east. It's often wet in the west, and sometimes warm in the south.
- Which seasons do you like best?
- I like spring and summer. The days are long and the nights are short. The sun rises early and `sets` late. I don't like autumn and winter. The days are short and the nights are long. The sun rises late and sets early. Our climate is not very good. But it's certainly interesting. It's our favorite subject of conversation.
