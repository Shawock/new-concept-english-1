How's Jimmy today?

- Was he absent from school last week?

He was absent on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday.
How are you `all keeping`?

> - 第一遍完全听不懂在讲什么机机，只知道在问候，但是为什么用过去式？
> - 第二遍猜测：“你刚才在肉店吗？”“是的，你也在吗？”“不在的，我在蔬菜店。”
> - 第三遍不懂为什么是 How are you ok pin? 和 stair my mother's? 而且为什么又lucky了？
> - 解释：
> `How are you ok pin?` -> `How are you all keeping?`你们身体都好么?
> `stair my mother's` -> `stay at my mother's` at后面的t是不发音的
> `Ahh? You are lucky` -> `Aren't you lucky!` 用否定表示感叹语气
> - `greengrocer` 蔬菜水果商；菜贩
> - `spend` 原型 [ 过去式 spent 过去分词 spent 现在分词 spending ]
