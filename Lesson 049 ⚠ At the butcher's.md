## Lesson 49 ⚠ At the butcher's

- Do you want `any` meat today, Mrs. Bird?
- Yes, please.
- Do you want `beef` or `lamb`?
- Beef, please.
- This lamb's very good.
- I like lamb, but my husband doesn't.
- What about `some` `steak`? This is a nice piece.
- Give me that piece, please. And a pound of `mince`, too.
- Do you want `a chicken`, Mrs. Bird? `They're very nice`.
- No, thank you. My husband likes steak, but he doesn't like chicken.
- To tell you the truth, Mrs. Bird. I `don't like chicken either`.
