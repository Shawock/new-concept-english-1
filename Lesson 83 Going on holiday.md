- Hello, Sam. Come in.
- Hi, Sam. We're having lunch. Do you want to have lunch with us?

I had one after my lunch.
- Let's `go into` the living room, Carol.
We can have our coffee there.
- Excuse the mess, Sam.
This room is very untidy.
We're packing our suitcases.
We're going to leave tomorrow.
Tom and I are going to have a holiday.
- Aren't you lucky!
- `When are you going to have a holiday`, Sam?

home这个词比价特殊，在它前面是不需要加任何冠词的。
比如go home, arrive home, back home（换成其他名词，比如school 则应该说成go to school, arrive at school, back to school)
