## Lesson 43 Hurry up

- Can you make the tea, Sam?
- Yes, of course I can, Penny. Is there any water in this `kettle`?
- Yes, there is.
- Where's the tea.
- It's over there, behind the teapot. Can you see it?
- I can see the teapot, but I can't see the tea.
- There it is. It's in front of you.
- Oh, yes. I can see it now. Where are the cups?
- There're some in the `cupboard`. Can you find them?
- Yes, here they are.
- Hurry up, Sam! The kettle's bowling.
