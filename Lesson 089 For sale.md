## Lesson 89 For sale

- Good afternoon. 
I believe that this house is for sale.
- That's right.
- May I have a look at it, please?
- Yes, of course. Come in.
- How long have you lived here?
- I've lived here for twenty years.
- Twenty years! That's a long time.
- Yes, I've been here since 1976.
- Then why do you want to sell it?
- Because I've just retired. 
I want to buy a small house in the country.
- How much does this house cost?
- `£68,500`.
- That's a lot of money!
- It's worth every `penny` of it.
- Well, I like the house. 
But I can't decide yet.
My wife must see it first.
- Women always have the last word.
