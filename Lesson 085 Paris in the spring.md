- Hello, Ken.
- Hi, George.
- `Have you just been to the cinema?`
- Yes, I have.
- `What's on?`
- `'Paris in the spring'.`
- Oh, I've already seen it.
I saw it on television last year.
It's an old film, but it's very good.
- Paris is a beautiful city.
- `I've never been there. 
Have you ever been there`, Ken?

I was there in April.
- Paris in the spring, `eh?`

It rained all the time.
- Just like London.
