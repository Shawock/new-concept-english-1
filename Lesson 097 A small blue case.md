## Lesson 97 A small blue case

- I left a `suitcase` on the train to London `the other day`.
- Can you describe it, sir?
- It's a small blue case. 
And `it's got a zip`. 
There's a label on the handle with my name and address on it.
- Is this case yours?
- No, that's not mine.
- What about this one?
`This one's got a label`.
- Let me see it.
- What's your name and address?
- David Hall, 83, Bridge Street.
- That's right. D...N... Hall, 83, Bridge Street.
Three pounds fifty `pence`, please.
- Here you are.
- Thank you.
- Hey!
- What's the matter?
- This case doesn't belong to me.
You've given me the wrong case.
