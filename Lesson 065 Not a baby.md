## Lesson 65 Not a baby

- What are you going to do this evening, Joe?
- I'm going to meet some friends, Dad.
- You mustn't `come home` late. You must `be home` at 10:30.
- I can't `get home` so early, Dad. Can I `have the key to the front door`, please.
- No, you can't.
- Joe's 18 years old, Tom. She is not a baby. Give her the key. She always comes home early.
- Ohh... All right.
- Here you are. But you mustn't come home after 11:15. `Do you hear?`
- Yes, Dad. Thanks mom.
- That's all right. Goodbye. Enjoy yourself.
- We always enjoy ourselves, Mom. Bye bye.
