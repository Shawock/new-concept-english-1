## Lesson 91 Poor Ian /i/

- Has Ian sold his house yet?
- Yes, he has.
He sold it last week.
- Has he moved to his new house yet?
- No, not yet.
He's still here.
He's going to move tomorrow.
- When? Tomorrow morning?
- No, tomorrow afternoon.
I'll miss him. He has always been a good neighbour.
- He's a very nice person.
We'll all miss him. 
- When will the new people move into this house?
- `I think that they'll move in the day after tomorrow.`
- Will you see Ian today, Jenny?
- Yes, I will.
- Please give him my regards.
Poor Ian, `he didn't want to leave this house.`
- `No, he didn't want to leave.`
But his wife did.

> - 虽然听的都对，但是有些不太理解
> - `I think that they'll move in the day after tomorrow.` 宾语从句
> - `No, he didn't want to leave.` `No, he didn't...` 是对前面观点的肯定，这跟中文的用法习惯不同，简单来说，当对方用否定疑问句时，你就当否定不存在去回答即可。判断 yes/no 的真实意思应该结合后面跟的话
