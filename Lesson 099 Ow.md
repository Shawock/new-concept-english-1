## Lesson 97 Ow!

- Ow!
- What's the matter, Andy?
- I `slipped and fell downstairs`.
- Have you hurt yourself?
- Yes, I have. I think that I've hurt my back.
- `Try and stand up`. Can you stand up?
Here! Let me help you.
- I'm sorry, Lucy. 
I'm afraid that I can't get up.
- I think that the doctor `had better` see you.
I'll phone doctor Carter.
The doctor says that he will come at once.
I'm sure that you need an X-ray, Andy.

> - `had better`不是`would better` 最好是 `would better` 比较罕见
