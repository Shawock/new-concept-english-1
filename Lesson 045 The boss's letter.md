## Lesson 45 The boss's letter

- Can you come here a minute please, Bob?
- Yes, sir?
- Where's `Pamela`?
- `She's next door.` She is in her office, sir.
- Can she type this letter for me? Ask her, please.
- Yes, sir.
- Can you type this letter for the boss please, Pamela?
- Yes, of course I can.
- Here you are.
- Thank you, Bob.
- Bob!
- Yes? What's the matter?
- I can't type this letter. `I can't read it.` The boss's handwriting is terrible.
